# Sainsburyâ€™s Tech Front End Exercise

This repo contains a project as per [Sainsbury's Front End Exercise](https://jsainsburyplc.github.io/front-end-test/).

# Technologies

## React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Jest

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

# Features

## Products

The initial view of this app displays a list of products in product cards.

Fetching data from [products](https://jsainsburyplc.github.io/front-end-test/products.json), the product cards show the product image, name, SKU and price.

## Basket

Users are able to add and remove items to/from their basket from its product card.

I have used [React's Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#when-to-use-context) to handle the basket state as this application is small as is its global state, with no complex logic.

In a real world example Redux would probably be the better option as I would expect this products page to be part of a larger application, potentially with a larger and more complex global state.

# Testing

Unit tests: This project is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing.

Jest coverage (as of 17/07/2022):
